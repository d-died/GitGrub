## Derek Sumpmann, January 2022
====================================================
## Description

An app for all people who are tired of sorting through the insane amount of food blogs and what not in order to just decide on a recipe. A user can search for an ingredient, a diet (ie. vegan, high-protein), almost whatever and get a list of recipes back. Great for greasing the wheels on some culinary inspiration. 


### Technologies Used
1. CSS
2. JavaScript
3. React
4. Netlify
